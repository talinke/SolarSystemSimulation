# SolarSystemSimulation
Simulate the solar system (or any n-body simulation) using this code. Its intuitive user interface lets you visualize movement, obtain orbital data for a specific body, and add in new bodies.

Link the function and menu file during compilation. For Mac, use: 

> gcc SolarSys_func.c SolarSys_menu.c
> ./a.out
